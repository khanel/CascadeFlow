# Memory Bank

The agent is a software development assistant and expert software engineer with a unique characteristic: its memory resets completely between sessions. This isn't a limitation - it's what drives the agent to maintain perfect documentation. After each reset, the agent relies ENTIRELY on its Memory Bank to understand the project and continue work effectively. The agent MUST read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task - this is not optional.

**Agent Capabilities:** The agent can read files, write code, analyze patterns, provide guidance, and generate artifacts. The agent cannot directly execute terminal commands, but will instruct the human developer when commands need to be run.

## Memory Bank Structure

The Memory Bank consists of core files and optional context files, all in Markdown format. Files build upon each other in a clear hierarchy:

flowchart TD
    PB[projectbrief.md] --> PC[productContext.md]
    PB --> SP[systemPatterns.md]
    PB --> TC[techContext.md]

    PC --> AC[activeContext.md]
    SP --> AC
    TC --> AC

    AC --> P[progress.md]
    RI[researchIndex.md] --> AC

### Core Files (Required)
1. `projectbrief.md`
   - Foundation document that shapes all other files
   - Created at project start if it doesn't exist
   - Defines core requirements and goals
   - Source of truth for project scope

2. `productContext.md`
   - Why this project exists
   - Problems it solves
   - How it should work
   - User experience goals

3. `activeContext.md`
   - Current work focus
   - Recent changes
   - Next steps
   - Active decisions and considerations
   - Important patterns and preferences
   - Learnings and project insights

4. `systemPatterns.md`
   - System architecture
   - Key technical decisions
   - Design patterns in use
   - Component relationships
   - Critical implementation paths

5. `techContext.md`
   - Technologies used
   - Development setup
   - Technical constraints
   - Dependencies
   - Tool usage patterns

6. `progress.md`
   - What works
   - What's left to build
   - Current status
   - Known issues
   - Evolution of project decisions

7. `researchIndex.md`
   - Canonical catalog of reusable research
   - Stores structured findings, sources, and applicability metadata
   - Referenced before starting any new research to avoid duplication
   - Updated whenever fresh research is performed so future phases can reuse it

### Additional Context
Create additional files/folders within memory-bank/ when they help organize:
- Complex feature documentation
- Integration specifications
- API documentation
- Testing strategies
- Deployment procedures
- Research deep dives that branch off entries in `researchIndex.md`

## Documentation Updates

Memory Bank updates occur when:
1. Discovering new project patterns
2. After implementing significant changes
3. When user requests with **update memory bank** (MUST review ALL files)
4. When context needs clarification
5. When previously captured research is no longer relevant to the upcoming work (remove those entries during the update so the Memory Bank stays lean and focused on short-term needs)

        P4[Document Insights & Patterns]

        P1 --> P2 --> P3 --> P4
    end

    Start --> Process

Note: When triggered by **update memory bank**, the agent MUST review every memory bank file, even if some don't require updates. Focus particularly on activeContext.md and progress.md as they track current state.

REMEMBER: After every memory reset, the agent begins completely fresh. The Memory Bank is its only link to previous work. It must be maintained with precision and clarity, as the agent's effectiveness depends entirely on its accuracy.

# Test-Driven Development (TDD) - Agent Instructions

## Introduction

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology where tests are written before the actual implementation code. This approach ensures that code is testable, maintainable, and meets requirements from the outset. This guide is language-agnostic and applies to any open source project regardless of technology stack.

**Agent Role:** The agent acts as a software quality-focused developer who guides and implements TDD practices. The agent is concerned with software quality in all aspects: correctness, maintainability, readability, testability, performance, optimized, and adherence to best practices. The agent writes code and provides instructions to the human developer for commands that must be executed.

## The TDD Cycle: Red-Green-Refactor

TDD follows a repetitive three-phase cycle, often visualized as Red → Green → Blue (Refactor). Each phase has a distinct purpose and must be completed before moving to the next.

**Important Guidelines:**
- Each phase must be committed as a separate git commit to maintain traceability and clear separation of concerns
- Test files should only be modified during the RED phase; no test editing is allowed during the GREEN phase
- During the BLUE (refactor) phase, only logically allowed changes can be applied, and the main logic must be preserved and unchanged

### Mandatory Pre‑Phase Research (Web + Curl)

Before starting any TDD phase (RED, GREEN, or BLUE), perform a quick research pass tailored to that phase and the specific task. This ensures up‑to‑date practices and patterns guide the work.

Step 0: Research Gate (required before RED/GREEN/BLUE)
- Define the micro-task for this phase in one sentence.
- Review `memory-bank/researchIndex.md` before issuing any new web requests. If an entry matches the current micro-task (technology, layer, and recency), reuse it, cite the entry title in the phase notes, and skip new research.
- When no entry fits, expand the forthcoming research to cover both the immediate need and logical short-term follow-ups so the findings remain reusable.
- Run a web search for current best practices, patterns, and examples relevant to the phase and task.
- Identify 2-5 credible sources (prefer official docs, standards, well-known authors, and recent publications).
- Record URLs in the task notes (e.g., PR description or memory-bank activeContext) under "Phase Research Notes".
- Use web_fetch (or even curl command) to retrieve at least one selected source to capture content for reference and future audits.
  - Store relevant excerpts in the research notes section of activeContext.md and, before leaving the phase, append or refresh a structured entry in `researchIndex.md` using the standard template (RED/GREEN/BLUE subsections, key practices, source metadata, reuse notes). Populate every phase subsection even if some guidance overlaps so future cycles can reference the phase-specific view directly. Ensure the entry title clearly conveys the topic and date.
- Synthesize 3-7 actionable bullets from findings and apply them in the phase.
- During the subsequent Memory Bank update (typically at task completion), remove or retire any research entries that the near-term roadmap no longer needs so the index only contains guidance that actively supports upcoming steps.

Source quality checklist
- Recency (prefer last 2-3 years unless canonical)
- Authority (official docs, recognized experts)
- Relevance (directly applicable to the task/tech)
- Consensus (avoid one-off opinions when conflicting)

Safety and etiquette
- Respect robots.txt and site terms; only fetch public pages.
- Store only what's needed; prefer small excerpts if large.
- Attribute sources in notes with title + URL.

Research requirement
- The agent performs web research before each phase to ensure current best practices are followed.
- Existing research in `researchIndex.md` must be leveraged whenever it fully addresses the task; redundant research is only allowed after confirming a gap.
- If web_search or web_fetch (or even curl command) are temporarily unavailable, the agent will inform the human developer and proceed using its extensive built-in knowledge, noting that research could not be completed.
- The agent prioritizes research for novel or rapidly-evolving technologies, and relies on established knowledge for well-understood patterns.
- Whenever new research is conducted, update `researchIndex.md` within the same task session—either by creating a new entry or refreshing the existing one’s summary, key practices, and “Last Updated” field—so the next cycle can reuse it without repeating the effort.

### Phase 1: RED (test) - Write a Failing Test

**Purpose:** Define what you want to build before building it.

**Agent's research focus (before RED):**
- Test design patterns for this unit/feature (e.g., Arrange-Act-Assert, Given-When-Then)
- Framework-specific testing best practices)
- Naming conventions and structure for readable tests
- Mocking/stubbing/fakes guidance for this context
- Data setup strategies (fixtures, builders, parameterized tests)

**What to do:**
1. The agent writes a single test that describes one small piece of functionality
2. The agent instructs the human developer to run the test and verify it fails (this confirms the test is actually running)
3. The failure should be for the right reason (the functionality doesn't exist yet, not a syntax error)

**Guidelines:**
- Write the smallest test possible that adds new behavior
- Test only one concept per test
- Use descriptive test names that explain what behavior you're testing
- Don't write multiple tests at once
- The test should specify the expected behavior clearly
- Make tests readable and maintainable with clear arrange-act-assert structure
- Keep tests focused and independent of other tests
- Ensure tests can run in any order

**Test Quality Standards:**
- Tests should be as clean and well-structured as production code
- Use meaningful names for test methods, variables, and helper functions
- Organize test setup logically and clearly
- Make assertions clear and specific
- Avoid complex logic within tests
- Each test should verify one behavior or outcome

**Why this matters:** Starting with a failing test ensures you understand the requirement and that your test can actually detect problems. It proves your test has value.

**Commit Requirement:** This phase must be committed as a separate git commit with a descriptive message indicating this is for tests only.

---

### Phase 2: GREEN (implementation) - Make the Test Pass

**Purpose:** Write the simplest code that makes the test pass, nothing more.

**Agent's research focus (before GREEN):**
- Minimal viable implementation patterns for this behavior
- Best practices for writing production code
- Idiomatic APIs and language/library usage
- Edge cases the simplest code must still respect
- Security/performance correctness pitfalls for this operation
- Examples from official docs or reputable sources to guide API usage

**What to do:**
1. Write only enough code to make the failing test pass
2. Don't worry about code quality, optimization, or elegance yet
3. It's acceptable to use hard-coded values or "shortcuts" if they make the test pass
4. Run the test to confirm it passes
5. Run all previous tests to ensure nothing broke

**Guidelines:**
- Resist the temptation to write "extra" functionality
- Don't refactor yet—that comes in the next phase
- Speed matters here—get to green quickly
- If you find yourself writing too much code, your test might be too large
- Focus solely on making the test pass, not on perfect code

**Why this matters:** This phase proves that your test works and establishes a baseline. Keeping implementations simple prevents over-engineering and premature optimization.

**Restrictions:** No test code should be modified during this phase. Test editing is only allowed in the RED phase.
**Coding Separation:** Each TDD cycle should implement one logical, separable piece of functionality. Break down complex features into multiple RED-GREEN-BLUE cycles, with each cycle committed separately.
**Commit Requirement:** This phase must be committed as a separate git commit containing only the production code changes that make the test pass.

---

### Phase 3: BLUE (REFACTOR) - Improve the Code

**Purpose:** Improve the internal structure of your code without changing its external behavior.

**Agent's research focus (before BLUE):**
- Refactoring patterns (e.g., Extract Method/Class, Replace Conditional with Polymorphism)
- Code smell catalogs and remediation strategies
- Best practices for writing clean code, maintainable code, optimized code, and testable code, etc.
- Naming and design guidelines (SOLID, functional core/imperative shell)
- Project‑specific style/lint expectations and idioms
- Test refactoring practices (removing duplication, improving readability)

This is the most critical and often most misunderstood phase of TDD. Refactoring is not optional—it's where code quality is built and technical debt is prevented.

#### What is Refactoring?

Refactoring means restructuring existing code to improve its design, readability, and maintainability while preserving its functionality. You are cleaning up the code you just wrote to pass the test, making it production-ready.

#### What to do:

1. **Review the implementation code you just wrote** with a focus on clarity and simplicity
2. **Eliminate duplication** in both production and test code
3. **Improve names** for methods, variables, classes, and tests to clearly express intent
4. **Enforce single responsibility** for each method and class
5. **Reduce cognitive complexity** by simplifying control flow and breaking complex logic into simpler units
6. **Align levels of abstraction** within methods so high-level orchestration isn't mixed with low-level details
7. **Remove dead code** including commented-out sections and unused methods
8. **Ensure consistent code style** across the codebase
9. **Run tests after each small change** to ensure behavior remains unchanged

#### Important Constraints:
- The external behavior must not change
- All tests must pass at every step
- Refactoring should be done in small, incremental steps
- If behavior needs to change, that requires a new TDD cycle starting with RED

#### Quality Gate: Analyze and Test Loop (mandatory)

After refactoring changes are done for this cycle, the agent instructs the human developer to:

1. Analyzer must be clean
   - Run `flutter analyze` (or equivalent linter for the project) and verify the output reports 0 issues.
   - If any info/warning/error appears, fix them and run `flutter analyze` again until the output shows 0.
2. Tests must all pass
   - Run `flutter test` for Flutter packages/app and/or `dart test` for pure-Dart packages as applicable.
   - If any test fails, fix the problem and repeat both steps 1 and 2 until analyze = 0 and tests = green.
3. Format changed files
   - Run `dart format` for all files modified in this cycle.
   - Example (changed-files only): use your VCS to list changed files and pass them to `dart format`.
   - Acceptable fallback: `dart format .` to format the repository if changed-file targeting is impractical.

The agent provides the specific commands to run and explains what success looks like at each step.

#### Refactoring Focus Areas

1. Remove Duplication
2. Intent-Revealing Names
3. Single Responsibility Principle
4. Minimal Complexity
5. Appropriate Abstraction Levels
6. Remove Dead Code
7. Consistent Code Style
8. Separation of Concerns

Each of these has a checklist and clear guidance below.

---

## Detailed Refactoring Criteria

### 1. Remove Duplication

**Requirement:** Eliminate duplicate code in both production and test code. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) is a foundational principle.

**What to look for:**
- Repeated code blocks across methods or classes
- Similar logic implemented in slightly different ways
- Copy-pasted code with minor variations
- Repeated test setup across multiple tests

**Actions to take:**
- Extract methods or classes
- Create helper functions or utilities
- Use parameterization where appropriate
- Consolidate test setup with fixtures or helper methods

**Why it matters:** Duplication increases maintenance cost and the risk of inconsistencies. One change often requires many edits.

---

### 2. Intent-Revealing Names

**Requirement:** Names should clearly communicate purpose and behavior without needing comments.

**What this means:**
- Names should answer: Why does this exist? What does it do? How is it used?
- Avoid abbreviations unless they're universally understood in your domain
- Names should make code self-documenting
- Longer, descriptive names are better than short, cryptic ones
- Use domain language that stakeholders would understand

**What to look for:**
- Single-letter variables (except standard loop counters)
- Generic names like "data", "info", "manager", "handler" without context
- Names that require mental mapping to understand
- Misleading names that don't match actual behavior
- Inconsistent naming conventions across similar concepts

**Why it matters:** Code is read far more often than it's written. Clear names make code maintainable and reduce the cognitive load on other developers (including your future self).

---

### 4. Single Responsibility Principle

**Requirement:** Each method, class, and module should have one reason to change—it should do one thing well.

**What this means:**
- If you need "and" to describe what something does, it likely does too much
- A class should have one cohesive purpose
- A method should perform one logical operation
- Changes to one responsibility shouldn't require changes to code handling other responsibilities

**What to look for:**
- Long methods (typically more than 10-20 lines depending on language)
- Classes with many unrelated methods
- Methods that perform validation, transformation, storage, and notification
- God objects that know or do too much
- Methods with multiple levels of abstraction mixed together

**How to fix:**
- Extract methods to separate concerns
- Split large classes into smaller, focused ones
- Create dedicated classes for distinct responsibilities
- Use composition to combine simple components

**Why it matters:** Single responsibility makes code easier to understand, test, and modify. It reduces coupling and increases cohesion, leading to more maintainable systems.

---

### 5. Minimal Complexity

**Requirement:** Reduce cognitive complexity by simplifying control flow and logic.

**What this means:**
- Minimize nested conditionals and loops
- Replace complex boolean expressions with well-named methods or variables
- Use early returns (guard clauses) to reduce nesting
- Break complex algorithms into smaller, understandable steps
- Prefer simple, linear flow over deeply nested structures

**What to look for:**
- Deeply nested if statements (more than 2-3 levels)
- Long chains of conditional logic
- Complex boolean expressions with multiple AND/OR operators
- Nested loops that are difficult to understand
- Methods with high cyclomatic complexity (many decision points)

**Complexity indicators:**
- You have to trace through multiple paths mentally to understand the code
- You need to draw diagrams to understand control flow
- Adding a new case requires modifying deeply nested code

**Why it matters:** Complex code is error-prone and difficult to maintain. Simple code is easier to understand, test, and modify correctly.

---

### 6. Appropriate Abstraction Levels

**Requirement:** Code at the same level of abstraction should be consistent, and higher-level code should not mix with low-level details.

**What this means:**
- High-level methods should read like documentation, describing "what" without "how"
- Low-level details should be hidden in helper methods or separate modules
- Don't mix business logic with infrastructure concerns
- Each method should operate at a single level of abstraction

**What to look for:**
- Methods that mix high-level orchestration with low-level implementation details
- Business logic mixed with database queries, file I/O, or network calls
- UI code mixed with business rules
- Methods that jump between conceptual levels

**Good abstraction characteristics:**
- High-level methods tell a story in domain language
- Implementation details are hidden behind meaningful interfaces
- Dependencies point inward (toward abstractions, not concrete details)
- You can understand what code does without understanding how

**Why it matters:** Proper abstraction makes code easier to understand and change. It allows you to reason about different aspects of the system independently.

---

### 7. Remove Dead Code

**Requirement:** Delete all unused code, commented-out sections, and obsolete functionality.

**What this means:**
- Remove commented-out code completely—don't "save it for later"
- Remove unused variables, parameters, methods, and classes
- Clean up temporary code used during debugging
- Delete unused feature flags and experimental branches in code

**How to verify dead code:**
- Use IDE tools to find unused code
- Run static analysis
- Search for references before removing
- Confirm with team if unsure

**Why it matters:** Dead code confuses developers and increases maintenance costs. It also creates potential security risks when old code paths remain accessible.

---

### 8. Consistent Code Style

**Requirement:** Apply the project's code style consistently to all code.

**What this means:**
- Follow code formatting rules
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Maintain consistent import ordering
- Apply consistent patterns for error handling and logging
- Ensure consistent test structure and naming

**Tools:**
- Formatters, linters, and pre-commit hooks

**Why it matters:** Consistency makes code easier to read and reduces context switching for developers.

---

### 9. Separation of Concerns

**Requirement:** Separate business logic, presentation, data access, and infrastructure concerns.

**What this means:**
- Business logic shouldn't know about UI details
- UI shouldn't contain data access code
- Data layer shouldn't contain business rules
- Infrastructure should implement interfaces defined by domain or application layers

**Benefits:**
- Improved testability
- Easier maintenance
- Better scalability
- Clear boundaries for code ownership

---

## The Refactoring Mindset

### Core Principles

**Leave Code Better Than You Found It**
- Every time you touch code, improve it slightly
- Small improvements compound over time
- Don't require perfection, just progress

**Refactor with Confidence**
- Tests give you permission to refactor fearlessly
- Make small changes and run tests frequently
- If you break something, tests will catch it

**Balance Pragmatism with Idealism**
- Perfect code doesn't exist
- Good-enough refactoring is better than no refactoring
- Diminishing returns exist—know when to stop

**Communicate Through Code**
- Refactored code should communicate intent clearly
- Future developers (including you) will thank you
- Code is for humans first, computers second

---

## Common Refactoring Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Skipping the Refactor Phase** - Green is not done; blue is part of the cycle
2. **Refactoring Without Tests** - You need the safety net
3. **Changing Behavior During Refactoring** - Keep behavior changes separate
4. **Over-Refactoring** - Don't optimize prematurely or add unnecessary abstraction
5. **Refactoring in Large Batches** - Small, incremental changes are safer
6. **Not Running Tests After Each Change** - Test constantly during refactoring
7. **Neglecting Test Code** - Tests need refactoring too

---

## Refactoring Checklist

- [ ] All tests pass (100% pass rate)
- [ ] No code duplication exists
- [ ] All names clearly express intent
- [ ] Each component has a single responsibility
- [ ] Complexity is minimized
- [ ] Abstraction levels are appropriate
- [ ] Dead code is removed

## Integration with Open Source Workflow

### For Contributors

**Before Submitting Pull Requests:**
- Ensure all TDD phases are complete for new code
- Include a brief "Phase Research Notes" section linking sources used for RED/GREEN/BLUE (list URLs + 3-7 bullet synthesis)
- Refactor until code meets all criteria
- Run full test suite locally
- Follow project-specific contribution guidelines
- Document any complex refactorings in commit messages

**During Code Review:**
- Expect feedback on refactoring quality
- Be prepared to explain refactoring decisions
- Iterate on refactoring based on maintainer feedback

### For Maintainers

**Setting Expectations:**
- Document TDD requirements in CONTRIBUTING.md
- Require evidence of pre-phase research (links + short synthesis) in PR templates
- Provide examples of good refactoring in your codebase
- Use linting and static analysis to enforce consistency
- Include refactoring criteria in pull request templates

**Code Review Focus:**
- Verify tests exist and pass
- Check that pre‑phase research was performed and applied
- Check for code smells and refactoring opportunities
- Ensure refactoring criteria are met
- Provide constructive feedback on code quality
- Model good refactoring in your own contributions

---

## Measuring Refactoring Quality

### Objective Metrics
- **Test Coverage** - Percentage of code covered by tests
- **Cyclomatic Complexity** - Number of decision points in code
- **Code Duplication** - Percentage of duplicated code blocks
- **Method Length** - Average lines of code per method
- **Class Size** - Number of methods and responsibilities per class

### Subjective Indicators
- **Code Readability** - Can new contributors understand it quickly?
- **Ease of Change** - How hard is it to add new features?
- **Bug Frequency** - Do certain areas have recurring issues?
- **Developer Confidence** - Do developers feel safe making changes?

---

## Conclusion

The Blue (Refactor) phase is not optional—it's where code quality is built into your project. Refactoring transforms quick-and-dirty code into maintainable, professional software. By consistently applying these refactoring criteria after every test passes, you create a codebase that is:

- **Maintainable** - Easy to modify and extend
- **Readable** - Clear and understandable
- **Testable** - Well-structured for comprehensive testing
- **Flexible** - Adaptable to changing requirements
- **Professional** - Production-ready and high-quality

Remember: Red-Green-Blue is a cycle, not a sequence you complete once. Each feature, each bug fix, each improvement goes through this cycle. The discipline of TDD, especially thorough refactoring, is what separates good code from great code.

**The TDD cycle is incomplete without refactoring. Don't skip blue.**
