# Active Context: CascadeFlow

## Current Development Focus

### Primary Feature: Ingest
- **Status**: Active development
- **Scope**: Capture item management with inbox functionality
- **Current Work**: Provider implementation and widget development
- **Open Files**: `capture_providers.dart`, `capture_inbox_list.dart`

### Architecture Implementation
- **Feature-Sliced Design**: Modular packages with clear boundaries
- **Riverpod Integration**: Code-generated providers with annotation-based setup
- **Infrastructure Stubs**: In-memory implementations for early development

## Recent Changes

### Provider Registry
- Infrastructure providers established for storage and logging
- In-memory Hive initializer for development testing
- Secure storage stub for key management

### Core Domain Events
- `DomainEvent` base class for event-driven architecture
- Specific events: `CaptureItemArchived`, `CaptureItemFiled`, `FocusSessionCompleted`
- Event system foundation for cross-feature communication

### Dependency Updates
- Migrated from `hive` to `hive_ce` for Dart 3.9+ compatibility
- Updated `go_router` to latest version (16.2.4)
- Maintained compatibility with Flutter 3.24+ constraints

## Active Decisions

### State Management Pattern
- **Chosen**: Riverpod with code generation
- **Rationale**: Type safety, testability, and reduced boilerplate
- **Implementation**: `@riverpod` annotations with `build_runner` generation

### Storage Strategy
- **Chosen**: Hive CE with encrypted boxes
- **Rationale**: NoSQL flexibility, offline-first, cross-platform
- **Security**: AES encryption with keys stored in secure storage

### Navigation Architecture
- **Chosen**: go_router with StatefulShellRoute
- **Rationale**: Preserves tab state, nested navigation support
- **Implementation**: Tab-based navigation with stack preservation

## Current Patterns & Preferences

### Code Organization
- **Domain First**: Business logic before UI implementation
- **Functional Core**: Pure functions with side effects at boundaries
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing throughout with generated code

### Testing Approach
- **Test-Driven Development**: Red-green-refactor cycle for all new features
- **Unit Tests**: Domain logic and providers with TDD
- **Widget Tests**: UI component integration with behavior-driven tests
- **Integration Tests**: Feature workflow validation
- **Stubs**: In-memory implementations for isolated testing

### Error Handling
- **Domain Layer**: `TaskEither<Failure, Result>` pattern
- **Presentation Layer**: Provider state with error states
- **User Experience**: Graceful error messages and recovery options

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. Complete ingest feature implementation
2. Establish focus session management
3. Implement review workflow foundation
4. Add comprehensive testing coverage

### Technical Debt
- Replace infrastructure stubs with real implementations
- Implement proper error boundaries in UI
- Add performance monitoring and optimization
- Establish CI/CD pipeline

### Feature Roadmap
- **Phase 1**: Core capture and focus workflows
- **Phase 2**: Review and analytics features
- **Phase 3**: Advanced scheduling and insights
- **Phase 4**: Multi-device synchronization

## Known Issues & Blockers

### Current Limitations
- Infrastructure layer uses in-memory stubs
- No real data persistence yet
- Limited error handling in UI components
- Basic theming without full Material 3 implementation

### External Dependencies
- Some packages require Flutter 3.27+ for full compatibility
- Platform-specific implementations pending
- Notification permissions not yet handled

## Development Environment

### Active Tools
- VS Code with Flutter extensions
- Build runner for code generation
- Hot reload for rapid iteration
- Test runner for continuous validation

### Workflow Preferences
- Feature-branch development
- Pull request reviews for quality control
- Automated testing on commits
- Documentation updates with code changes
