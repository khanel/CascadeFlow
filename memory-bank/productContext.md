# Product Context: CascadeFlow

## Why CascadeFlow Exists

CascadeFlow addresses the challenge of maintaining productivity in an information-saturated world. Users need tools to capture ideas efficiently, focus on high-priority tasks, and regularly review their progress to ensure they're moving toward meaningful goals.

## Problems Solved

1. **Information Overload**: Too many ideas, tasks, and notifications competing for attention
2. **Focus Fragmentation**: Difficulty maintaining deep work sessions in a distraction-filled environment
3. **Progress Blindness**: Lack of visibility into whether efforts align with long-term goals
4. **Workflow Inefficiency**: No systematic way to process captured items into actionable work

## How It Should Work

### Core User Journey
1. **Capture**: Quick entry of ideas, tasks, and notes throughout the day
2. **Process**: Regular review sessions to clarify and organize captured items
3. **Focus**: Time-blocked work sessions on prioritized tasks
4. **Review**: Weekly/monthly assessment of progress and goal alignment
