# Progress: CascadeFlow

## Current Status: Early Development Phase

### Overall Project Health
- **Architecture**: ‚úÖ Established (feature-sliced design implemented)
- **Core Infrastructure**: üü° Partially complete (stubs in place, real implementations pending)
- **Feature Development**: üü° Ingest feature in active development
- **Testing**: üü° Basic test structure established
- **Documentation**: ‚úÖ Comprehensive docs and memory bank initialized

## What's Working

### Project Structure
- ‚úÖ Modular package architecture (core, infrastructure, features, app)
- ‚úÖ Feature-sliced design with clear layer separation
- ‚úÖ Proper pubspec.yaml configurations for all packages
- ‚úÖ Analysis options and code quality standards

### Core Domain
- ‚úÖ Domain events system (`DomainEvent` base class)
- ‚úÖ Failure and Result types for error handling
- ‚úÖ Value objects (`EntityId`) for domain modeling
- ‚úÖ Event definitions for key business processes

### Infrastructure Foundation
- ‚úÖ Provider registry with Riverpod integration
- ‚úÖ In-memory Hive initializer for development
- ‚úÖ Secure storage stub implementation
- ‚úÖ Logging infrastructure setup

### Development Workflow
- ‚úÖ Build runner configuration for code generation
- ‚úÖ Test framework setup across packages
- ‚úÖ VS Code project configuration
- ‚úÖ Git repository with proper ignore patterns

### Ingest Presentation
- ‚úÖ Inbox list supports swipe-to-archive with undo snackbar and Riverpod invalidation
- ‚úÖ Swipe-to-delete confirms via dialog and reports failures with snackbars
- ‚úÖ Inbox repository sorts items newest-first so recent captures appear at the top
- ‚úÖ Repository returns unmodifiable inbox lists to prevent downstream mutation bugs
- ‚úÖ Inbox repository supports optional limit parameter for batched loading
- ‚úÖ Inbox provider fetches 50-item batches by default to reduce unnecessary loads
- ‚úÖ Inbox repository honors `startAfter` cursor to resume pagination seamlessly

### Testing
- ‚úÖ Provider tests cover `CaptureQuickEntryController` success and failure flows
- ‚úÖ Widget tests validate `CaptureQuickAddSheet` submission lifecycle and error handling
- ‚úÖ Widget tests cover `CaptureInboxList` loading, empty, data, and error states
- ‚úÖ Gesture tests exercise capture inbox archive/delete flows and undo interactions

## Known Issues

### Current Blockers
- **Infrastructure Stubs**: Real platform integrations needed for production use
- **Data Persistence**: No permanent data storage currently implemented
- **Error Recovery**: Limited error handling in user-facing components
- **Platform Compatibility**: Some packages require Flutter SDK updates

### Technical Limitations
- **Flutter Version**: Current setup limited to 3.24, some packages need 3.27+
- **Platform Features**: iOS/Android specific features not yet implemented
- **Offline Capability**: No offline data synchronization
- **Security**: Basic encryption setup, advanced security features pending

## Evolution of Decisions

### Architecture Choices
- **Initial Decision**: Feature-sliced architecture for scalability
- **Validation**: Clear separation of concerns, independent feature development
- **Outcome**: Successful implementation, good developer experience

### Technology Selections
- **Riverpod**: Chosen for type safety and testability over Provider/GetIt
- **Hive CE**: Selected for Dart 3+ compatibility over original Hive
- **go_router**: Preferred for navigation flexibility over auto_route
- **fpdart**: Adopted for functional programming patterns

### Development Practices
- **Test-Driven Development**: TDD for domain logic and business rules
- **Code Generation**: Build runner for Riverpod providers
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests first, integration tests for workflows
- **Documentation**: Memory bank system for project continuity
